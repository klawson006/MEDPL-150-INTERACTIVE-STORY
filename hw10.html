<p>You're an alien on planet Opalescent, 20000 lightyears away from earth. While life feels easy here, baking a cake for your picky friend's birthday is not. And what's worse? You lost the inconveniently specific recipe for it! It is up to you to remember the correct order of ingredients, or show up cake-less to your friends birthday party in 3 hours. Remember: time is star bucks! (and no, not the coffehouse chain that those weird humans rave about). On your marks, get set, BEGIN! </p>
